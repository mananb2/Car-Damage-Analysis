# Car-Damage-Analysis
# Car Damage Analysis using Image Processing

## Overview
This project leverages deep learning and image processing techniques to analyze car damages from images. The system detects and classifies different types of damages, assisting insurance companies and automotive industries in streamlining the claims and repair processes.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Enhances image quality for better analysis.
- **Damage Detection**: Identifies and highlights car damages using deep learning models.
- **Classification**: Categorizes damages based on severity (minor, moderate, severe).
- **Automated Report Generation**: Generates reports with detected damage areas and severity assessment.
- **Business Application**: Can be integrated into insurance claim automation and repair estimations.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning)
- CNN-based Object Detection Models
- Flask (for Web API Integration)
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/car-damage-analysis.git
   cd car-damage-analysis
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Upload an image of a damaged vehicle.
- The model analyzes and detects damage areas.
- The system classifies the damage and provides an assessment report.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the **Car Parts and Car Damages Dataset** from Kaggle, containing labeled images of vehicle damages.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integration with Mobile Apps** for real-time damage analysis.
- **Enhanced Model Training** with additional datasets.
- **Cost Estimation Module** to predict repair costs.
